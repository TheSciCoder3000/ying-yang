          <h2>About us:</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Our founder Tanisha, together with her partners at YinYang, are
              business psychologists who have spent over a decade working with
              fast-growing businesses, fortune 500 companies, ambitious leaders,
              and high-performing teams. Across every success and every
              struggle, they discovered the same truth: culture is intangible,
              but its impact is impossible to ignore.
            </p>
            <p>
              That insight became the seed of YinYang Leadership. Rooted in the
              philosophy that opposites must come together to form a whole, we
              help organizations design the leadership and cultural foundations
              that unlock faster business performance and long-term success.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through our proprietary Culture Compass, we bring evidence based
              tools, powerful facilitation, and an immersive learning
              experience. Whether weâ€™re co-creating leadership journeys,
              redesigning ways of working, or guiding you through complex
              change, our purpose is clear: to make workplaces more conscious,
              connected, and alive; so your people and your business thrive
              together!
